# jpotter.xyz

This is my personal website built with [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework). It showcases my work as a data developer and includes interactive weather visualizations.

## Project Overview

The site consists of:
- Home page with my bio and technical stack
- Real-time weather dashboard for Black Mountain, NC
- Gallery of my data projects
- Visualization journal

## Development

To start the local preview server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to preview the site.
