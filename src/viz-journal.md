    <h3>Hurricane Helene Rainfall Analysis</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    This chart clearly indicates the extreme amount of rain received from Helene at Asheville Regional Airport, causing widespread flooding throughout the region.
  </p>
  <p>
    From September 24th through September 27th, 2024, this station recorded 14.19 inches of precipitation. For the entire month of September, the station recorded 17.77 inches of precipitation. Even with the other 26 days of this period including one day of 2.27 inches, these four days still account for 80% of the rain total for the month.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of December 11, 2024, the State of North Carolina has verified 103 storm-related fatalities; 43 coming from Buncombe County alone. <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/assistance/hurricane-helene-recovery-resources/hurricane-helene-storm-related-fatalities">(ncdhhs.gov)</a> This county includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, as well as our own vibrant Town of Black Mountain. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In Black Mountain, we were without water and power for more than three weeks. While the region's infrastructure was decimated, including more than 7,200 incidents of road and bridge damage.
  </p>
  <p>    
    The lasting effects of this storm will be felt for generations, with some hollows and small towns completely washed away. Though the several-billion dollars needed for rebuilding the region is an enormous figure, the cultural significance of what was lost is priceless.
