    <h3>Hurricane Helene Rainfall Analysis</h3>
    <h4>2024/12/14</h4>
  </header>
  <p>
    This chart clearly indicates the extreme amount of rain received from Helene at Asheville Regional Airport, causing widespread flooding throughout the region.
  </p>
  <p>
    From September 24th through September 27th, 2024, this station recorded 14.19 inches of precipitation. For the entire month of September, the station recorded 17.77 inches of precipitation. Even with the other 26 days of this period including one day of 2.27 inches, these four days still account for 80% of the rain total for the month.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of December 11, 2024, the State of North Carolina has verified 103 storm-related fatalities; 43 coming from Buncombe County alone. <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/assistance/hurricane-helene-recovery-resources/hurricane-helene-storm-related-fatalities">(ncdhhs.gov)</a> This county includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, as well as our own vibrant Town of Black Mountain. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In Black Mountain, we were without water and power for more than three weeks. While the region's infrastructure was decimated, including more than 7,200 incidents of road and bridge damage.
  </p>
  <p>    
    The lasting effects of this storm will be felt for generations, with some hollows and small towns completely washed away. Though the several-billion dollars needed for rebuilding the region is an enormous figure, the cultural significance of what was lost is priceless.

    <h3>Tennessee Volunteer Baseball Historical Trajectory</h3>
    <h4>2024/12/15</h4>
  </header>
  <p>
    The Tennessee baseball program has demonstrated remarkable growth over its 128-year history, with an impressive overall record of 2,291 wins, 1,686 losses, and 14 ties, achieving a historical winning percentage of 57.6% across 3,977 total games played.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under current head coach Tony Vitello, the program has reached unprecedented heights, posting a 72.5% win rate (295-112) since 2018. This includes three seasons ('20, '22, and '24), with a winning percentage above .800. This performance significantly surpasses the program's historical averages and represents a golden era in Tennessee baseball.
  </p>
  <p>
    The program's foundation was built by several long-tenured coaches who have left lasting legacies. Bill Wright (19 seasons, 407-309-2) and Rod Delmonico (18 seasons, 699-396) stand out for their longevity and success. Delmonico's 699 wins remain the most in program history, while Wright's nearly two decades of leadership provided crucial stability during the program's development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent performance metrics highlight the program's upward trajectory. In the past 21 seasons (2004-2024), Tennessee has maintained a 59.5% winning percentage, demonstrating consistent improvement above the program's historical average. This period has seen significant investments in facilities, coaching, and player development, resulting in enhanced competitive success.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the program's evolution, there's a clear pattern of increasing success and stability. From the challenging early years, including the program's lowest point in 1958 (2-13-1 under George Cafego), to the modern era's sustained excellence, Tennessee baseball has transformed into one of the nation's premier programs. This growth reflects not just athletic achievement, but the development of a comprehensive program that consistently competes at the highest level of collegiate baseball. And in 2025, Tennessee Baseball will take the diamond as the reigning National Champions.
