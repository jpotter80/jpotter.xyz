## Stellar Classification

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in automating stellar classification between giant and dwarf stars. The integration of a PostgreSQL database enhances data accessibility and management. Future work may include refining the model with additional features, exploring other classification algorithms, and expanding the dataset to include more diverse stellar types.
