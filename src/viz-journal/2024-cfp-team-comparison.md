<h3>College Football Playoff Team Comparison</h3>
<h4>2024/12/17</h4>
</div>
</header>

<p>
The College Football Playoff teams display distinct offensive and defensive characteristics that highlight their paths to qualification. Looking at the scatter plot of points per game versus points allowed per game, we can identify several key patterns in team performance.
</p>

<p>
Indiana leads all teams in offensive production, averaging a commanding 40.3 points per game, closely followed by Notre Dame with 39.8 points per game. These high-powered offenses set the standard for scoring efficiency in the playoff field, though strength of schedule certainly plays a factor.
</p>

<p>
Georgia, while posting more modest offensive numbers at 31.9 points per game, earned their spot through facing the toughest schedule (ranked #1 in strength of schedule) while maintaining a respectable points allowed average of 21.8. Their ability to perform consistently against elite competition underscores their playoff worthiness.
</p>

<p>
Other notable performers include Boise State (37.7 ppg) and Oregon (36.9 ppg), who both demonstrate strong offensive capabilities while maintaining competitive defensive metrics. SMU rounds out the top five scoring offenses with 36.8 points per game, showcasing the depth of offensive talent in this year's playoff field.
</p>

<p>
A deeper analysis reveals an inverse relationship between offensive output and strength of schedule. The teams with the highest scoring averages generally faced easier schedules: Indiana (40.3 ppg, SOS: 42nd) and Boise State (37.7 ppg, SOS: 70th) exemplify this trend. Conversely, teams that faced the toughest schedules show more modest scoring numbers: Georgia (31.9 ppg, SOS: 1st), Texas (33.6 ppg, SOS: 3rd), and Ohio State (35.5 ppg, SOS: 9th). Oregon and Notre Dame stand out as exceptions, maintaining high scoring averages (36.9 and 39.8 ppg respectively) despite facing relatively challenging schedules (18th and 21st). This pattern suggests that while offensive production is important, it must be evaluated within the context of schedule difficulty when assessing a team's playoff credentials.
